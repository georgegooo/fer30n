# =============================================================================
# FAIE — Phase 3: Shadow-Logging Helper (Phase-2 spec §5)
# =============================================================================
# CONSTITUTIONAL NOTICE: this module is the single call site allowed to run
# ChiefDecisionOfficer next to a REAL decision cycle. It is still subject to
# every rule in docs/FAIE/VOLUME_1_CONSTITUTION.md:
#   - LOGGING ONLY. Nothing here is read back into the real decision path.
#   - log_faie_shadow_decision() must NEVER raise and must NEVER be able to
#     change, delay, or block the real decision it is logging next to. Every
#     failure mode (bad ctx, disk full, import error, whatever) is swallowed
#     and reported through the return value only.
#   - This module does not import trade_executor / execution_optimizer_v2 /
#     MetaTrader5 / any order-sending code, same as the rest of brain/faie —
#     see tests/faie/test_faie_master_brain.py::test_no_execution_capability,
#     extended in tests/faie/test_shadow_logging.py for this file specifically.

        real_decision_summary: optional small dict describing what
            unified_decide() actually chose (decision/composite_score/
            risk_multiplier are enough — NOT the full DecisionResult object,

            is what lets §6's backtest harness later compute agreement_rate
            without re-deriving it from two separate log files.
        log_path: override the destination path (mainly for tests).

        True if a line was successfully appended, False on ANY failure.
