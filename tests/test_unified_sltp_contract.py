"""
Test: Unified SL/TP Finalization Contract [FER3ON-2026-08-31]

Verifies that all trade entry points (main.py, strategy_runners.py, 
trade_executor.py) use the single source of truth for SL/TP finalization 
(core/sl_tp_finalizer.py::finalize_sl_tp).

This ensures no place in the codebase computes SL/TP independently or
bypasses the safety caps/floors that the finalizer enforces.
