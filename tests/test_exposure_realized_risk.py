"""Regression tests for FER3ON_FINAL_CHANGELOG.md [EXPOSURE-1] and [EXPOSURE-2].

[EXPOSURE-1]: core.portfolio_risk_authority's aggregate exposure cap
(MAX_RISK_TOTAL) sums the `risk_percent` field recorded per open trade. Before
this fix, callers recorded the *nominal* pre-sizing risk_percent (a small
0.10-0.75% figure from an unrelated formula in main.py), not the actual
dollar risk implied by the final lot and SL. After [SLTP-2]'s MIN_LOT_RISK_GUARD,
actual risk on a $200-$1000 account is typically ~1-5% per trade -- so the
exposure cap was checking aggregate risk against numbers 5-10x too small and
could never trigger before real risk got dangerous.

[EXPOSURE-2]: core/strategy_runners.py's SCALP/SWING/MICRO paths lacked the
same-direction concentration cap that main.py's SMC path already had.
