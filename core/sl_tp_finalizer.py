# =============================================================================
# FER3ON FINAL [SLTP-4]: single, authoritative SL/TP finalization pipeline.
# =============================================================================
# Before this module existed, three different places independently
# re-derived the "final" SL/TP that would actually reach the broker:
#
#   1. main.py::_build_order_request                (SMC path)
#   2. core/strategy_runners.py::_build_order_request_generic (SCALP/SWING/MICRO)
#   3. core/trade_executor.py::execute_trade          (the ONE place that
#      actually sends the order, retries on stops-too-close, and records
#      the trade to the DB / AI-memory)
#
# Each of them applied its own subset of the rules — SL floor + account-size
# cap, TP floor, an ATR-based sanity ceiling — in a slightly different order,
# and #3 always ran AFTER #1/#2 using the RAW (pre-builder) sl_dist/tp_dist
# it was passed as separate function arguments, not the request dict #1/#2
# had already adjusted. That is exactly how the earlier bugs happened:
# whatever #1 or #2 computed (e.g. an ATR-capped TP) was silently discarded,
# because #3 recomputed everything from scratch with looser rules and that
# recomputation is what actually got sent to the broker.
#
# Now there is ONE function — `finalize_sl_tp` — that all three call with
# the SAME raw inputs (the adaptive engine's own sl_distance/tp_distance,
# before any floor/cap has touched them). Being a pure, deterministic
# function of those inputs, every caller now agrees by construction: there
# is no "builder computed X but the executor sent Y" possible anymore,
# because there is only one place the computation happens.
#
# Pipeline (always in this order):
#   1. SL: broker-min-stop floor, then MAX_SL_DISTANCE_DOLLARS account-size
#      cap (see settings.py for the full reasoning).
#   2. TP: rescaled to preserve the risk:reward ratio the adaptive engine
#      actually chose (tp_dist_raw / sl_dist_raw), reapplied to the REAL
#      (post-cap) SL. This is what keeps TP proportional to what is truly
#      at risk instead of a stop distance that got capped away.
#   3. TP: optional secondary ATR sanity ceiling, per-strategy
#      (get_tp_cap_multiplier / get_tp_sl_multiplier). Runs AFTER step 2's
#      rescale, on top of it — belt-and-suspenders against a pathological
#      RR (e.g. a corrupted higher-timeframe structure target), never the
#      primary mechanism and never allowed to push TP below the real SL.
#   4. tp_tiers (the TP1/TP2/TP3 multi-TP ladder): each tier already carries
#      its own fixed `rr` from MULTI_TP_PROFILE, so its distance/price are
#      recomputed directly from that `rr` and the FINAL sl — not scaled by
#      an approximate factor. Informational/analytics only today (nothing
#      in this codebase places broker-side partial-TP orders from it), but
#      it must still reflect the real SL so logs/DB/dashboard aren't
#      misleading.
